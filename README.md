# SpeechSurf - Easy Digital Navigation for Everyone

SpeechSurf is a tool that revolutionizes interaction with digital devices by enabling users to navigate interfaces through **voice commands**. This **AI-powered** program allows precise control of the mouse and keyboard by specifying sections of the screen to click on, streamlining tasks that traditionally require physical movement. Whether it is pausing a video, turning pages in an e-book, or scrolling through a webpage, these actions can now be executed effortlessly with **simple voice commands**. Users can also automate  keyboard presses, allowing them to enter text into search bars and text editors with ease.

We built the landing page of this application in **ReactJS + CSS**, using **Figma** for prototyping. Our backend was built entirely in Python, primarily using the following libraries: **Hugging Face Inference API** + **PyAudio** (for speech recognition), **Tkinter** (to display grid overlay for clicking) **PyAutoGUI** (to control keyboard and mouse), and **Pillow** (to create and process screenshots for clicking). We bundled the app into a .exe file using PyInstaller.

This project is designed to cater to a diverse audience. While many of us share the privilege of being able-bodied, there is a significant group does not enjoy that same privilege. SpeechSurf addresses this disparity by reimagining how people interact with technology, taking into account the needs of handicapped individuals who face **accessibility** challenges. In other words, we empower them with a new **perspective** in exploring life.

Speech Surf aims to bridge the gap between technology and inclusivity, ensuring that **everyone** can enjoy a seamless digital experience.
